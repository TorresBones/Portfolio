# React Portfolio

## Desription
This is my professional portfolio created with React. It features an about me section on the homepage, a projects page showcasing all the projects I've worked on, with a button to navigate to their individual pages, and a resume page displaying a screenshot of my resume with a download button. Additionally, it includes social media icons in the footer that allow users to directly access my social media profiles and contact me.

## Contributors
- React Bootstrap
- Nelson Foster and Tom Woods (Teacher Assistants)
